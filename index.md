# About Me

I am a current third-year mechanical engineering student at Lehigh University with senior standing graduating in the spring of 2021. I am currently exploring different industries within mechanical engineering, particularly aerospace, energy, technical consulting, or research. I have a wide array of classroom experience, ranging from fluid mechanics to programming in java. I am involved with [Lehigh University's Engineers Without Borders](https://liam-magargal.github.io/Engineers-Without-Borders/). In the fall of 2019, I led a group to develop a proposal for an off-grid refrigeration system. Additionally, I work in [Lehigh University's Community Service Office](https://liam-magargal.github.io/Community-Service-Office/) as a Student Service Coordinator. At the Community Service Office, I coordinate and lead service events in the Bethlehem/Lehigh Valley area. During the summer of 2020, following the cancellation of an internship, I began [research](https://liam-magargal.github.io/Computational-Aerodynamics-Research/) with a professor at Lehigh developing a MATLAB program that predicts the wake of wind turbines.
