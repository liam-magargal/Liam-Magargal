# About Me

I am a junior in mechanical engineering at Lehigh University. I grew up in Hockessin, Delaware, where I attended Salesianum School. At Salesianum, I explored a few different potential career options by enrolling in several Advanced Placement (AP) courses. After taking the AP exams, I recieved 29 credits from Lehigh University as an incoming first-year student. At Lehigh University, I have engaged in several organizations, including [Lehigh University's Engineers Without Borders](https://liam-magargal.github.io/Engineers-Without-Borders/) and the Community Service Office. Upon completion of my first year at Lehigh, I determined my best path would be to spend the summer at Lehigh taking courses to continue to get ahead. By the fall, I had essentially completely caught up with the class of 2021, and decided to focus on graduating in 2021, instead of 2022. In the fall of 2019, I led a project for the Engineers Without Borders to write a proposal for an off-grid refrigeration system. Currently, I am exploring my career options, particularly in aerospace engineering, technical consulting, energy engineering, and research.
