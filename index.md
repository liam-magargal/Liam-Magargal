# About Me

I am a current second-year mechanical engineering student at Lehigh University with senior standing graduating in the spring of 2021. I am currently exploring different industries within mechanical engineering, particularly aerospace, energy, technical consulting, or research. I have a wide array of classroom experience, ranging from fluid mechanics to programming in java. I am involved with [Lehigh University's Engineers Without Borders](https://liam-magargal.github.io/Engineers-Without-Borders/). In fall 2019, I led a group to develop a proposal for an off-grid refrigeration system. Additionally, I work in [Lehigh University's Community Service Office](https://liam-magargal.github.io/Community-Service-Office/) as a Student Service Coordinator. At the Community Service Office, I coordinate and lead service events in the Bethlehem/Lehigh Valley area. I am actively searching for an internship for the summer of 2020.
