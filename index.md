# About Me

I am a junior in mechanical engineering at Lehigh University. I grew up in Hockessin, Delaware, where I attended Salesianum School. At Salesianum, I explored a few different potential career options by enrolling in several Advanced Placement (AP) courses. After taking the AP exams, I recieved 29 credits from Lehigh University as an incoming first-year student. At Lehigh University, I have engaged in several organizations, including Lehigh University's Engineers Without Borders and the Community Service OFfice. Upon completion of my first year at Lehigh, I determined my best path would be to spend the summer at Lehigh taking courses to continue to get ahead. By the fall, I had essentially completely caught up with the class of 2021, and decided to focus on graduating in 2021, instead of 2022.
